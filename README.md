# Flight-Delay-Prediction---Machine-Learning-Classification

  This project is about flight delay prediction using supervised machine learning classification.  The aim of this project is to know what factors affect the delay and to make modelling. 
  There are some data pre-processing that I did, namely split data, handling outlier, adding new column, mean encoding for categorical variable, handling imbalance data using oversampling SMOTE and also drop some columns. After doing modelling with some models, it known that KNN model is the best one with recall value 60%.
  I also have done tunning with several parameters, however there is no difference with the recall value of best model. So, I don't display the process on project.
